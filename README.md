# 👋 Hi, I'm Alessio

I'm a **Frontend Developer** focused on creating clean, responsive, and interactive web experiences.

🌍 After nearly 10 years living and working in London, I returned to Italy to fully dedicate myself to web development.  
💻 I enjoy building intuitive UIs using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **modern CSS**, and I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **Django REST** and exploring **Node.js**.  
🎯 My current goal is to grow as a remote developer and collaborate with international teams.
